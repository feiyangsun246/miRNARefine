# miRNARefine

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
Useful Tool to Refine and Improve the Quality and Interpretability of miRNA Expression Data.

## Description

`miRNARefine` is an R package which aims to identify and correct potential data irregularities such as outliers, batch effects, and instability in miRNA expression across samples, and to provide diagnostic visualizations that help researchers assess data reliability before downstream analyses.

`miRNARefine` was developed in the following environment:  
R version: 4.5.1 (2025-06-13) - "Great Square Root"  
Platform: Windows 11 x64(x86_64, mingw32)

## Installation

You can install the development version of miRNARefine like so:
``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("feiyangsun246/miRNARefine", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("TestingPackage")
```
To run the Shiny app:
```r
# Under construction
```

## Overview

To list all functions available in the package: 

``` r
ls("package:miRNARefine")
```
`miRNARefine` contains 7 functions:

1. _*adaptiveFiltering*_ Automatically filters miRNAs based on expression, variance, or missing
values.
2. _*detectOutliersPCA*_ Identifies anomalous samples using principal component analysis.
3. _*missingValueHandling*_ Detects and imputes missing values in the miRNA dataset. Supports
adaptive methods like mean, median, or KNN imputation.
4. _*compareNormalization*_ Applies multiple normalization methods (e.g., log2, z-score, quantile)
and compares their effects.
5. _*detectBatch*_ Detects and optionally corrects batch effects in the dataset.
6. _*miRNAStability*_ Calculates feature-level stability metrics such as coefficient of variation (CV) or median absolute deviation (MAD).
7. _*plotStabilityDistribution*_ Visualizes the distribution of miRNA stability metrics across
all features. Highlights highly stable or highly variable miRNAs, helping users quickly assess
feature quality.

The package also contains two datasets, called miRNASeq1 and miRNASeq2. Refer to package vignettes for more details. An overview of the package workflow is illustrated below.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(miRNARefine)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
